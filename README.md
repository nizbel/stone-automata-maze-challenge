# About
This repository is my submission to the 2nd phase of the 
[Stone Automata Maze Challenge](https://sigmageek.com/challenge/stone-automata-maze-challenge).
I got 7th place.

Each of the folders represents one of the 5 challenges presented. The first challenge
is a better optimized version of the first phase.

I tried my best to organize the code as I wrote it, but there was some
commented out code left. Especially on challenge 4 which I spent many hours
trying to develop a code to solve the puzzle, only to end up creating a 
base filled version to solve manually.
